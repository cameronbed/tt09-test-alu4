## How it works
The ALU is a compact 4-bit computational unit that precomputes common values and uses a case-based approach to efficiently handle arithmetic, logical, and cryptographic operations. Its design allows rapid processing of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise logic, and a encryption feature, making it ideal for embedded systems requiring versatile computational and cryptographic capabilities with minimal resources.

## How to test
This will require some sort of controller to control the input and read the output.

## External hardware
External hardware is needed to transmit the 4-bit inputs and the 4-bit output.
